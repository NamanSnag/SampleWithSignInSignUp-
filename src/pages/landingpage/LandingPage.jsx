      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <h2>Welcome, to Naman World</h2>
      <p>
      Life is a journey, a winding road <br/>
Full of ups and downs, a heavy load <br/>
We walk with purpose, we strive to succeed <br/>
We face each challenge, with courage and speed <br/>
<br/>
We make mistakes, we stumble and fall<br/>
But we rise again, standing tall<br/>
We learn from our failures, we grow and evolve<br/>
And we cherish each moment, with those we love<br/><br/>

Life is a precious gift, a treasure to hold<br/>
A story to tell, a tale to unfold<br/>
We leave our mark, on the world we leave<br/>
And in the memories, of those we grieve<br/>
<br/>
So live each day, with passion and zest<br/>
Embrace the journey, with all its tests<br/>
For life is a journey, a winding road<br/>
Full of adventure, a story to be told.<br/>
      </p>
